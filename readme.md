# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, I showcase my various projects, including my work on an action game, as well as a website to display my portfolio itself.

## Action Game Project

In this project, I was tasked with creating monsters, levels, and their corresponding AI for an action game. It was a challenging yet exciting experience that allowed me to dive deep into game development.

### Process

I started by brainstorming ideas for the monsters and levels, considering factors such as gameplay mechanics and player experience. Once I had a clear vision, I moved on to designing and implementing the monsters, ensuring they were diverse and provided unique challenges for the players.

Next, I focused on level design, creating environments that complemented the monsters' abilities and encouraged strategic gameplay. Finally, I implemented AI behaviors for the monsters, making them responsive and engaging adversaries.

### Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges I faced was balancing difficulty levels across different stages of the game. To overcome this, I conducted extensive playtesting and gathered feedback from testers to fine-tune the gameplay experience.

Another challenge was optimizing the AI to ensure smooth performance on various platforms. I addressed this by refining the AI algorithms and implementing efficient coding practices.

### Lessons Learned

Through this project, I learned the importance of iteration and adaptability in game development. I also gained valuable insights into the intricacies of AI programming and level design, which have enhanced my skills as a game developer.

## Web Portfolio

Apart from the action game project, I also developed a website to showcase my portfolio. This provided me with an opportunity to explore web development and design principles.

### Process

I began by outlining the structure and layout of the website, keeping in mind the need for a clean and intuitive user interface. I then proceeded to design and implement the website, incorporating elements such as project showcases, contact information, and a brief about me section.

### Challenges and Solutions

One of the challenges I encountered was ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness across different devices. To address this, I utilized modern web development frameworks and extensively tested the website on various platforms.

Another challenge was effectively communicating my projects and skills through the website. I tackled this by organizing the content logically and providing clear descriptions and visuals for each project.
